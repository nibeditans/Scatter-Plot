# Scatter Plot with Mean and Standard Deviation Visualization
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to creating scatter plots with visualizations of mean and standard deviation. 
Scatter plots are widely used for exploring relationships between two variables, and the addition of mean and standard deviation indicators enhances the understanding of data distribution and variability.

The notebook demonstrates step-by-step instructions using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib to create insightful scatter plots and also pandas is used for data preprocessing. It covers various aspects, including data preprocessing, plotting the scatter plot, calculating mean and standard deviation, and visualizing them on the plot.

By following this notebook, you will learn how to transform raw data into informative scatter plots that highlight the central tendency and spread of the data. This visualization technique can be particularly useful for identifying outliers, understanding the data distribution, and comparing different groups or categories.


# Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you will need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pandas (for data preprocessing)


# Getting Started
